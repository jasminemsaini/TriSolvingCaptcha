# TriSolving Captcha

TriSolving Captcha simulates a Turing Test which helps to differentiate between humans and computers. This repository has two files. 


# Timed Captcha
The <b>TimedCaptcha.py</b> file has a time limit of 9 seconds which makes the task even more challenging because the users have to type the captcha fast and respond quickly to be successful. The program provides a novel captcha each time, when the user input is incorrect or when the time runs out. 

## How to Run Timed Captcha?
### 1. Install Python 
### 2. Run the following in the terminal after installing Python:
```
python TimedCaptcha.py
```


# Math Captcha 
The <b>MathCaptcha.py</b> has a user friendly interface (GUI.py). It instead requires users to solve a random math equation using BEDMAS rules (order of operations: Brackets, Exponents, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Substraction). The program notifies users when the input is incorrect and prompts users to solve another Math Captcha. The interface also gives the option to <i>refresh</i> if the user finds current Captcha difficult to solve.<br>
